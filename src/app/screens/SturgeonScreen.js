                Since prehistoric times, the sturgeon has remained greatly unchanged. So much so, Maereanu calls them
                “dinosaurs.” The fish retains many of the distinct characteristics it displayed during the Triassic
                period – a long, flat snout and smooth, scale-free skin, with a skeleton comprised mainly of cartilage.
                Its sluggish evolution has given the fish the status of a “living fossil.”

                However despite the work of Maereanu and others over recent decades, both the size and the population of

                luxury caviar trade – have driven the fish to the brink of extinction.

                In an attempt to conserve the species, fishing bans, first introduced by Ukraine then by Romania and

                Today, caviar retains a luxury status as the food of the rich and famous, but it wasn’t always so.
                During the 19th century, sturgeon were in such abundance across the east coast of the US that caviar
                would be served as bar snacks, the peanuts of their day. While in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus,

                It was only in the early 20th century, due to pollution and dams, that the sturgeon population began to
                decline. Recovering slightly during World War One, the population then fell to the point where the
                Soviet Union imposed limits on sturgeon fishing in 1939. Now regulated by rigid Soviet quotas, caviar
                was as abundant as it was cheap in the USSR’s largest cities.

                <br/>
                In the chaos that followed the break-up of the Eastern Bloc, the trade – like much of the former Soviet
                Union – spiraled out of control. Sturgeon were fished on a massive scale, flooding markets with caviar
                and driving demand. Exploiting weaknesses in the young Eastern European democracies, criminal gangs
                entered the market. They organized the fishing of the sturgeon, the production of caviar and its
                transportation to hubs such as Moscow, St Petersburg and wherever the world’s rich resided. The “caviar
                mafia” had been born.

                The gangs, working alongside and in conjunction with some legitimate producers, overfished the sturgeon.
                Profits to be derived from caviar were comparable with other criminal industries – prices for caviar are
                notoriously slippery, the cost of a kilo ranges from $1,000 to $6,000, while rare varieties can reach
                $25,000, a similar price to a kilo of cocaine.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The now dwindling sturgeon population led to a scarcity of caviar, maintaining the high price while also
                increasing the product’s exclusivity.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pressured by conservation groups, Ukraine was the first to introduce a ban on sturgeon fishing in 2000.
                It was followed by Romania in 2006 and Bulgaria in 2011, which acted after the IUCN warned that 85
                percent of sturgeon were at risk of extinction, “making them the most threatened group of animals on the
                IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The legal caviar trade adapted to the bans, with sturgeon aquaculture farms flourishing. Where once
                there were only a few dozen producers, there are now more than 2,000 worldwide – from small facilities
                in England and Italy to huge operations in China; the Kaluga Queen in Zhejiang Province now produces 35
                percent of the world’s caviar.

              “The production of a kilogram of caviar incurs a 90 percent cost compared with the retail price, so our
              margin of profit is very thin,” Maereanu bemoans. “The poachers obtain their caviar by destroying the wild

              <br/>

              Due to the opacity of the market, it is almost impossible to know how much illegally sourced caviar is
              being produced and consumed. According to Jutta Jahrl, sturgeon project leader for the World Wildlife

              hard to distinguish between the two.”

              While aquacultural farms were initially hailed as a solution for the industry, some are reportedly
              providing cover for the caviar mafia. TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, produced a report on
              caviar, which notes that certain farms work with poachers “informing them when the restocking takes place
              and when not to poach to be able to prove restocking has occurred.”

                Conservationists are sympathetic to the fishermen’s plight. “The real criminals are the ones paying the
                fishermen to poach,” says Jahrl, who contributes to education programs aimed at encouraging them to
                assist in the conservation of the sturgeon.

                Poaching blights the picturesque landscape along the Danube – sturgeon carcasses, their stomachs cut
                open, are often found on the river’s banks, discarded by poachers who harvested the caviar as soon as
                they got to land.

                Away from the river, the mafia has a variety of methods to “ethically wash” their wares. A common tactic
                is forging labels issued by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) or
                misbranding poached goods, passing them off as those from renowned and legitimate caviar producers.

              Much of Jahrl’s work involves distinguishing poached caviar sold at market. “We found there are parts of
              the legal industry that are whitewashing the illegal part … They get caviar from poached sturgeon, put it
              in tins of a bigger producer, put a nice label on it and then sell it. For the consumer, then, it is very
              hard to say is this farmed, legal caviar or is it illegal and poached.”
              <br/>
              <br/>
              To confuse matters, the sellers of poached caviar will at times shamelessly highlight how their product
              was illegally sourced due to an unsubstantiated notion among consumers that eggs from wild sturgeon are
              superior to those of reared fish. While conversely there are also reports that legal caviar will be passed
              off as illegal to drive up its price.

                Natalia Gozack, Jahrl’s colleague at the WWF, based in Ukraine, reported that customs officers have
                identified how caviar smuggling routes are also used to bring drugs or weapons into the EU. “To smuggle
                the caviar is less risky, so the next day you smuggle drugs because you’ve tried this route and you know
                it works,” she says.

                The fight to save the sturgeon is still in its infancy, a blanket ban across the Danube region hasn’t
                happened yet as Serbia is refusing to implement anything beyond restrictions. The EU, which has set up
                various task forces and programs aimed at saving the sturgeon, has limited powers as its jurisdiction
                stops at the border between Romania and Ukraine.

                “The WWF works with local fishermen who used to catch sturgeon when it was still an important part of
                their income ... Trying to support them to find other sources of income and try to explain to them that
                if they do not stop catching sturgeon, or release the sturgeon that they’ve caught, there are no future
                sturgeon and no future for sturgeon fishing. It’s in the fishermen’s hands if the sturgeon survives,” he
                says.

                Can the sturgeon survive, Maereanu thinks so. With a smile she explains how her team has put tens of

                their survival.
