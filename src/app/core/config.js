      description: 'For more than 200 million years, the sturgeon remained pretty much unchanged – growing up to seven meters long and sporting a long, flat snout and smooth, scale-free skin. But a combination of dams, pollution and overfishing – fueled by the hunger for luxury caviar – have driven the fish to the brink of extinction and you are now lucky to find one topping two-meters long. Now measures are in place to save it and border guards are fighting an ongoing – and sometimes deadly – battle with the “caviar mafia,” which leads the illegal trade in the fish’s eggs.',
